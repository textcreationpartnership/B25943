            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Model for a School for the better Education of YOUTH.</head>
            <p>REason differences a man from a Beast, Learning makes one man differ from another; therefore timely care ought to be taken in the Education of Gentlemen, that they may have some general Improvement in all kind of Knowledge before they begin to tast of Pleasure and will not bear the Yoak.</p>
            <p>Learning may be divided into two parts, First, the toylsome part, consisting in <hi>Reading, Writing,</hi> getting the <hi>Grammer,</hi> and the <hi>Copia Verborum;</hi> Secondly, the pleasant part, which may be divided into two Branches; First the Solid part, by which I mean the Knowledge of things, especially such things as are obvious to sense, as <hi>Herbs, Druggs, Seeds, Mineral-Juices, Metals, Pretious Stones, Birds, Beasts, Fishes, Anatomy, Astronomy, Geography, Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Arithmetick, Gardning, Planting,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Mechanick or Complemental part, As <hi>Dancing, Singing, Instrumental Musick, Fencing, Wrestling, Vaulting, Riding</hi> the manag'd Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>se, <hi>Military Discipline, Painting, Turning,</hi> &amp;c. My Intention is to Demonstrate how Gentlemen may attain at least some general Knowledge in most of these things in the time they spend at School, were Schools order'd as they might be.</p>
            <p>To this end, First <hi>Grammer</hi> must be made Short and Plain, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the Rudiments of it. Secondly, the way to gain the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia Verborum,</hi> must be made Easie; Thirdly, things obvious to Sense, must be learn't with words. Fourthly, one Master must not be charged with too many Schollars, suppose ten, or at most fifteen, and they must be all in one form. Fiftly, Professors must be always upon the place to teach the delightful part of Learning in the times of Intermission.</p>
            <p>I have perused all Models which have come to my hands, and have made the best Observation I could upon them, and I find none that offers fairer than <hi>M. Lewis</hi> of <hi>Tottenham High-cross:</hi> I have carefully examined his Notions, upon which he builds his whole <hi>Grammatical Hypothesis;</hi> They are mainly two. First, that the Rules of Grammer ought to be plain, that they ay be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Understood; especially because they are to be learn't by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to the meaness of whose capacities we ought to condescend; Now plainness in regard of the thing signifying, therefore the Rules ought not to be in <hi>Latine,</hi> much less in Verse: and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:205659:3"/> is in respect of the thing signified, Therefore it is not reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to use Logical Definitions in the Etymologia, nor second Notions in the <hi>Syntax</hi> of the introductory Grammar. He shews how most things in Grammer may be brought down to the sense of Seeing, in regard of the thing signified: For the better effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, he proposes a Technical Author, in which the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of Speech shall be Printed in a different Character, so that what he cannot describe by Rule, may be made sensible by Example.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, he saith the Rules of the <hi>Latine</hi> ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated particularly to the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and the Rules of the <hi>Greek</hi> to the <hi>Latine;</hi> because all improvement of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is by comparing what we are to learn, with something we know already, we tack on the New Notion to some old Idea we have before in our minds; It is a Law of Nature to proceed, <hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ad ignotum;</hi> by this means the Rules of Grammar become more short and easie to Understand, get, and keep.</p>
            <p>These things are more largly discussed in his Essay and Preface to his Grammar for the <hi>English, Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of about three sheets, Founded upon these two principles; From which principles he makes these Deductions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Grammer of the <hi>Latine</hi> may be accommodated to the <hi>English</hi> in the Etymologia, to know the parts of Speech thus. <hi>Substantives</hi> have a plural <hi>number,</hi> as <hi>Song, Songs</hi> No other part of Speech is distinguished in <hi>number</hi> in the <hi>English,</hi> besides <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantives, Adjectives</hi> have the same termination in both <hi>Numbers,</hi> as <hi>Good Song,</hi> Good songs, &amp;c So likewise the Rules for <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the <hi>Syntax</hi> ought to be by the <hi>English signs,</hi> which are, <hi>a, the, of, to, for, in, with, from, by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Declensions of <hi>Nouns</hi> and Conjugations of <hi>Verbs,</hi> are better known by the <hi>Theme,</hi> then by the <hi>Genitive Case,</hi> or <hi>Insini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mood,</hi> as <hi>Musa</hi> is of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3 He saith the <hi>G nders</hi> of <hi>Nouns</hi> ought to be concluded from the Declension, which may be done by five Rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5.
